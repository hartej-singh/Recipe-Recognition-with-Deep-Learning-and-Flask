In this project, we focus on applications of automatic food recognition and identify the recipe in food by using convolutional neural networks. And this model will classify images into food categories and to output a matching recipe.

I have used Convolutional Neural Network in our AI model and then used Flask to host it on a website.

Then, I built a Flask Application which needs HTML pages stored in the templates folder and a python script app.py for serverside scripting.

The saved model in this content is recipe_1000.h5. It is stored in Hierarchical Data Format.

The static folder will contain JS and CSS files.

Whenever the user upload an image to predict, that images are saved in a separate folder.
